    [Workflow: scripts](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/workflow-scripts.html).  Read all of this short piece about R script files.
    [R Markdown](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/r-markdown.html).  Look over sections 27.1 to 27.4, but only the introduction to 27.4 not all the details.  Feel free to look over the rest if you're curious.
    **Thursday**
    [Workflow: projects](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/workflow-projects.html). Read this entire section about R projects, environments, and file paths.  Students often strugle to keep these things straight, so look over this section carefully and come to class with questions about where you got lost. For the section about file paths, when you are working in R Studio on [rna.wlu.edu](http://rna.wlu.edu/r) you're in a linux environment.
    [Data transformation](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/transform.html).  Read all of this section about how you can use `tidyverse` functions to filter, rearrange and calculate new values in tables of data.

    **Tuesday**
    [Relational data](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/relational-data.html).  Read all of this section about how you can pull data from multiple sources.
    [Strings](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/strings.html) and [Dates and times](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/dates-and-times.html).  These two sections are both a little long and a little dry; skim over them.  It's likely that they contain information that will help you solve problems with strings and dates/time that you will run into working on your projects, and it will be good to have an idea of where to seek help when you do.
    **Thursday**
    [Factors](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/factors.html).  Read this section carefully as `factors` are a very powerful feature in R, but also very confusing at first.
