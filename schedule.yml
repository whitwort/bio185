We'll be using it extensively in this class.  You should also take a look at the [Data Wrangling Cheat Sheet](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/data-wrangling-cheatsheet.pdf).
    [Functions](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/functions.html).  Today will introduce how you can write your own functions to keep your code clean.  You don't need to read this chapter before class, but I want to point it out because it's a great reference and worth at least skimming over.
